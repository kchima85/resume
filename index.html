                    Karmbir is an engineer with a talent for Postgres, SQL, and ES6 javascript.
                    I've personally worked with him in creating tests, developing APIs, data transformation
                    and can attest to his abilities. He is thoughtful and has stood up to the test of many challenging
                    projects. Most importantly he's a pleasure to work with, who is receptive to feedback and always
                    pursuing professional growth.

                    During my time with Agent IQ, I've grown to truly respect KC.
                    He has the grit and fortitude to plow through challenging projects.
                    He always keeps scalability and efficiency in check, as he designs and implements new features.
                    In meetings, he is not afraid to raise thoughtful points with the company's best interests in mind.
                    At the same time, he is wonderful to work with, easy to pair program with and is able to clearly communicate
                    to bridge gaps in knowledge between front-end and back-end processes.
                    When not at work, he is always trying to improve himself as a programmer and grow as a person.
